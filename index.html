            <h1>How I Developed This Page</h1>
            <h2>What is Flask?</h2>
            <p>
                Flask is a web development framework that uses Python. It is used <br>
                for developing websites on a development server. I use flask to develop <br>
                my html website. <br><br>
            </p>
                
            <h2>How do you use it?</h2>
            <p>
                Run 'app.py'. It will open a localhost server, and from there, you can update your <br>
                website (in my case, index.html), and develop it to your liking. It does not rely on a real <br>
                server, and the refresh time is instant. This makes developing a website very easy to use <br>
                and all you need is to have it installed to develop your html website. <br>
                Once finished, I used github to host it for the public.

                <h2>Flask Installation</h2>
                <p>
                    1. Assuming Python already installed. <br>
                    2. Install Flask in command prompt using pip with command 'pip3 install Flask' <br>
                    3. Created simple Python program that uses flask to render our html page (index.html). <br>
                    4. Designed an index.html page, and styled with CSS.

            <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
            <p>
                - Flask follows specific filepaths (see flask documentation), <br>
                  this was conflicting with github's hosting requirements. <br>
                - Ensuring the python app was launching the development server properly.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="problem">
            <h2>Solutions</h2>
                <p>
                - Followed Flask's documentation to manually set my 'template' and 'static' folders, <br>
                  to comply with github's requirements <br>
                - Ensuring the correct 'language mode' I was running was the same as the one with flask installed. <br>
                  This solution may vary depending on the ide you use (I'm using VSCode).
